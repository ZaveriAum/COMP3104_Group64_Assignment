Is sushi chinese or japanese food?
The original type of sushi（すし）, known today as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟, fermented sushi), was first developed in Southeast Asia and spread to south China before introduced to Japan sometime around the 8th century. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish.
