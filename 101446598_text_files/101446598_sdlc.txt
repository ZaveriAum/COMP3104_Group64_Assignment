Acquiring knowledge DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle as it bridges development and operations, boosting collaboration and efficiency. DevOps uses Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to speed up development, automate processes, and enhance product quality by identifying bugs early. With the use of tools like Docker and Kubernetes, it improves scalability, and continuous monitoring guarantees more stability and quicker problem solving. Software delivery is accelerated, more dependable, and efficient with the help of DevOps, which also lowers operating expenses and downtime. Overall, it enables teams to release better software, more frequently, and with higher quality.
