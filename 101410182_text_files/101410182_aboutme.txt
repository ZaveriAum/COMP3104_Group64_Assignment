Hi my name is Elio Fezollar! I am currently a student at George Brown College in the third year first semester.
I love building stuff ranging from apps to websites and sometimes even contraptions using electronics. I am enjoying
the DevOps class so far as it is teaching me about things i didn't even know existed before.
Thank you!
