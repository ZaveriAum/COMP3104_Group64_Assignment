The devOps course is also known as COMP3104. It is a Course that is tought by professor Pritesh Patel
and it only takes play one day on a Wednesday from 6pm-9pm, including both the lab and the lecture
in the same day. It is online. So far it has taught us stuff sorrounding as the name says developer
Operations. Most of the time has so far been spent learning VSC, mainly github and github Pages/Travis
I like this course!
