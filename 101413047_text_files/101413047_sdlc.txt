DevOps encourages a culture of collaboration between the development and operations teams.
This helps in dissolving silos, thereby ensuring better communication and understanding between
these traditionally separated functions. DevOps aligns goals between development and operations so that
everyone is working toward the same objectives. This better communication leads to faster problem resolution
and also a more cohesive working environment. Automation: Automating key processes like testing, deployment,
monitoring, and scaling. This enhances productivity by saving time from manual and error-prone tasks.
